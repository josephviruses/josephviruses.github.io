Nightbot: &#34;Welcome to the TCEC chatroom, where we discuss everything but chess.&#34;
The Top Engine Chess Championship experience cannot be complete without the chat. The chat is hosted via Twitch and so it inherits the features of Twitch chats including some global emotes and the more than occassional toxicity, even among supposedly more educated and mostly STEM leaning chatters–who are perhaps mostly computer and engineering geeks and math nerds I surmise.</description>

      <description>My aim here is to try to analyze and make sense of what happened in the TCEC Seasono 15 SuFi, based on the ECO group of openings. Based on Jeroen Noomen’s blog, the following are the intended openings:
ECO code distribution ECO A: 15 lines ECO B: 14 lines ECO C: 11 lines ECO D: 3 lines ECO E: 7 lines However, the ECO code distribution may have changed because of some transpositions.</description>

      <description>I am fascinated about chess engines. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at first. In fact, the last time I ever used an engine for analysis, I used a version of Rybka. Like many people, I was interested with on the board chess when I was a kid, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get serious about it. It all changed when news of a neural network engine called Alpha Zero. Doing some quick search, I landed in Agadmator&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel, and that led me to Jerry&amp;rsquo;s ChessNetwork, and to KingsCrusher&amp;rsquo;s YouTube page.</description>
