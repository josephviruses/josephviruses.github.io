      <description>The Superfinals of the 17th season of the Top Engine Chess Championship (TCEC) has just concluded and Leela Chess Zero emerged as the champion against the mighty Stockfish with a final score of 52.5-47.5. Leela won 17 games (16 as white and 1 as black), drew 71 games, and lost 12 games (11 as black and 1 as white), to become the TCEC champion for the second time, after failing to qualify in season 16 (although it was undefeated in the Premier Division).</description>

      <description>My aim here is to try to analyze and make sense of what happened in the TCEC Seasono 15 SuFi, based on the ECO group of openings. Based on Jeroen Noomenâ€™s blog, the following are the intended openings:
ECO code distribution ECO A: 15 lines ECO B: 14 lines ECO C: 11 lines ECO D: 3 lines ECO E: 7 lines However, the ECO code distribution may have changed because of some transpositions.</description>

      <description>I am fascinated about chess engines. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at first. In fact, the last time I ever used an engine for analysis, I used a version of Rybka. Like many people, I was interested with on the board chess when I was a kid, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get serious about it. It all changed when news of a neural network engine called Alpha Zero. Doing some quick search, I landed in Agadmator&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel, and that led me to Jerry&amp;rsquo;s ChessNetwork, and to KingsCrusher&amp;rsquo;s YouTube page.</description>
